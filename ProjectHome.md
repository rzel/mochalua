# About Mochalua #

In mid 2008, the company [Groundspeak, Inc.](http://www.groundspeak.com) had a need to convert Lua to J2ME for a GPS-based gaming platform where custom location-based adventures are built in Lua. Groundspeak worked with [Nikitova](http://www.nikitova.com) to complete this project and Groundspeak now maintains and improves on the code base.

This is the resulting code that has been made open source under the MIT License. The hope is that others will support and continue to improve the code to support mobile device development with Lua.

## Assumptions ##

The code was developed under the following assumptions:

  * Lua will be ported from C to J2ME CLDC 1.1 (with floating operations).
  * All Java methods will have the same names as original C functions and will be placed in one Java class.
  * The Java version of Lua will be tested on the Sun WTK 2.5 emulator.
  * This would be a port of Lua version 5.1.3.
  * The original code release will not contain any device specific fixes.
